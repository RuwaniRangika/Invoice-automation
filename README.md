# Invoice-automation
This project aims to automate the handling of PDF invoices. The objective is to read the invoices from the directory into a MySQL database while verifying the correctness of the IBAN and reference numbers. Additionally, the system will ensure that the line item amounts match the total amount specified in the header information.
